title: Pathfinding Visualizer
excerpt:
  Pathfinding algorithm visualizer is a web application made with React. It generates a path between the start point and the end point on the grid. To find its path, it uses different algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm, Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, and A* Search. I also implemented a maze generation algorithm to create random mazes.

info:
  idea:
    The main idea of Algorithm visualizer is to show how algorithms works
    as visualization is the best way to understand how a certain thing works.
  tech: [ReactJS, NodeJS, Visual Studio]
